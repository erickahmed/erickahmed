👋 Hey, @erickahmed here! I'm 21 and currently studing Automotive Engineering at UniMoRe, but programming is my second passion after cars and machines!
I'm a self-taught software developer, tho I still have a long road after me to become truly proficient in it.
I hope to combine my two passions in one job, where I can design vehicle systems and do some low-level programming.
I'm also interested in the crypto revolution that is happening and all that it derives, like metaverse projects


- ⚙️ Undergraduate in Automotive Engineering (Bachelor's)
- 🔭 Graduate in Mechatronics Technology (Industrial Technical School)
- 👀 I’m interested in autonomous driving, crypto and metaverse
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Algorithms and Data Structures
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in the realm of autonomous driving and crypto
