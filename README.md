👋 Hey, @erickahmed here! I'm 21 and currently studing Automotive Engineering at UniMoRe, but programming is my second passion after cars and machines!
I'm a self-taught software developer, tho I still have a long road after me to become truly proficient in it.
I hope to combine my two passions in one job, where I can design vehicle systems and do some low-level programming.
I'm also interested in the crypto revolution that is happening and all that it derives, like metaverse projects
