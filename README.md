👋 Hey, @erickahmed here! I'm 21 and currently studing Automotive Engineering at UniMoRe, but programming is my second passion after cars and machines!
I'm a self-taught software developer, tho I still have a LONG road after me to become truly proficient in software developement, which is a very broad industry.
I hope to combine my two passions in one job, where I can design vehicle systems and do some low-level programming.
Currently I think that EV and autonomous driving are two niches that would be perfect for me



- 👀 I’m interested in Software Developement
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Algorithms and Data Structures
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in the realm of autonomous driving and related topics
